# The MET landing page

In this landing page, I developed a landing page based on a Figma design,
utilizing HTML and SCSS, following methodology BEM. Employing CSS Grid, I ensured a responsive layout that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes.
This approach allowed for efficient styling and maintenance, resulting in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

- Desktop 1260px
